# FamilyRecipes

- This will be an app to save and share recipes that my family uses. Now they can all be in one singular spot not all over the place!


tools
- [Serilog](https://serilog.net/) for logging
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) testing the api / Documenting it
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for more in depth testing of my API

> I may not use Seq
- [Seq](https://datalust.co/seq) for parsing through logs can read logs from many apps
